#### Procedures and functions

## Week 2 recap
#### Nested loops
	* Simply, a while loop within a while loop
	* Useful for 2-dimensional data (like grids)
```bash
   col
row 1 2 3 4 5
    1 2 3 4 5
    1 2 3 4 5
    1 2 3 4 5
    1 2 3 4 5
```


---

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define ROWS 5
#define COLUMNS 5

int main() {
    int i = 0;

    while (i < ROWS) {
        int j = 1;
        while (j <= COLUMNS) {
            printf("%d ", j);
            j++;
        }
        printf("\n");
        i++;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
This is an example of a nested loop which prints the grid from the previous slide


---
### structs
	* A defined structure of data types, each accessible
	* Memory is set aside for each field in each struct
	* Useful for assigning a variable to an organised record of data
```c
struct pokemon {
	int hp;
	double weight
};
```

### enums
	* A possible set of values
	* Useful for creating labels in your code
```c
enum elemental_type { FIRE, WATER, GRASS, DARK }; 
```

# Functions
	* So far, you have used functions in your code
	* Examples include `printf`, `scanf`, `main`...
	* What actually are these?

---
#### Functions
	* Functions are reusable blocks of code
	* Functions (may) have:
		* **input** (parameters)
		* **actions** (side effects)
		* **output** (results)

---
#### Functions
	* We **call** functions to execute their body, providing any input necessary
	* We can access the result of the function
	* We can call a function from anywhere in our programs

---
### Function definition example
```c
int add(int x, int y) {
	return x + y;
}
```
	* `int ...` -> return type (what **type** should the result be
	* `add` -> the name of the function
	* `(int x, int y)` -> the **parameters**, what sequence and type of input must be passed in?
	* `return` -> evaluate the expression and return the result
---
### Function call syntax
```c
add(2, 5);
```
	* After we define functions, we want to use them
	* The `()` after the name of the function means **call**
	* We must pass in the correct sequence of **arguments** of the correct type (`int add` required two integers).
---
### Function calling
	We can pass in variables too
```c
// A simple function which accepts two integers (x, y),
// and returns the result (int) of adding them.
int add(int x, int y) {
	return x + y;
}

int main(void) {
	int year_born = 1994;
	int age = 29;
	
	add(year_born, age);
}
```
---
### Retrieving the result of a function
```c
// A simple function which accepts two integers (x, y),
// and returns the result (int) of adding them.
int add(int x, int y) {
	return x + y;
}

int main(void) {
	int year_born = 1994;
	int age = 29;
	
	int current_year = add(year_born, age);
}
```

## DEMO
---
## Functions terminology
	* **return type** -> the type of data returned by the function
	* **result** -> the actual value returned from a function call
	* **parameters** -> the type, and sequence of data to be passed into a function (the placeholders)
	* **argument** -> the actual value passed into a function's parameters when called
	* **return** -> the keyword used to end a function and return the result following
---
## Procedures
	 not a *real* thing in C, but a useful way to think about some types and roles of functions
---
### Procedures
	* Not all functions have to return a result
	* We call these *void functions*, or *procedures*
	* Procedures **do** something, but don't have a result
	* procedures (usually) have a side-effect
---
### procedures
	`shut_door`
	side effect?
	result?

### functions
	`check_door_shut`
	side effect?
	result?
---
### procedure syntax
```c
void check_door_shut() {

}
```
	* This is a function which returns nothing (void)
	* We could call this a procedure
---
## Order matters
	Functions/procedures have to be defined before they care called
	* we can get around this with *function prototypes*
	* Place `int add(int x, int y);` at the top of your file to define the int add function for later use
---
### When writing functions in your program, think:
	* What **must** I give this function so it can do its job?
	* What should it be named?
	* What should it return back to me to achieve its goal? (If anything).
	* Am I re-writing code that could be turned into a reusable function?
---
### Functions are very important 
	* They change how we think about code
	* When you come across useful, repeatable functionality - make it a function
---
## 0, 1, âˆž
* If you have no need for a function yet, don't write it.
* If you have a single need for some code, write it but don't make it a function
* If you have a second need for the code, make it a function
