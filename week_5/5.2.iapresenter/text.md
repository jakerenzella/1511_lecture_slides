## Memory
	* All data (variables) are stored in **memory**
	* You can think of memory as a big grid
	* Each segment of this grid has a unique identifier
---
	Visualising memory with addresses

The actual data is stored in binary
---
### So far, we have only dealt with values
	* We can also access the address
	* By storing that address in a variable, we have a **pointer**

### Pointer Syntax
#### To declare a pointer
	`<type> *<name_of_variable>`
	^ The `*` means don't request the storage to store `<type>`, but requests memory to store a memory address of `<type>`
---

### Syntax example:
	`int *pointer`
	`struct student *student`
---
## Visualise pointer declaration
```c
// declare a pointer to an integer
int *number; // operating system returns 0x17
```

### *Address of* operator `&`
	* What if we want to query what the address of a variable is?
	* We can use the address_of operator:
	### `&`
---
## Syntax of address of: `&<variable>`
### Example
```c
int number = 2;
&number // the address of number
```
---
```c
int number = 2;


int *pointer_to_number = &number
```

## Dereferencing
	* Dereferencing is simply accessing the value at the address of a pointer
	* It uses the `*` symbol again (which causes confusion)
	* `*my_int_pointer` -> will get the integer at the address location
---
## Three components to pointers in code
```c
int main(void) {
	// Declare an integer
	int my_age = 23;

	// Declare an integer pointer
	// Assign it the address of my_age
	int *pointer_to_my_age = &my_age;

	// Print out the address and value at the pointer
	printf("Pointer is: %p value is: %d\n", pointer_to_my_age, *pointer_to_my_age)
	return 0;
}
```
---
## Common mistakes
```c
int number;
int *number_ptr;
```
	1. `number_ptr = number;`
	2. `*number_ptr = &number;`
1- number_ptr is a pointer, we can't assign it an actual value directly
2- We are assigning the address_of a variable to a dereferenced pointer (so an address)

---

## Syntax cheat sheet
	* Declare a pointer: `int *int_pointer;`
	* Address of: `&my_variable;`
	* Dereference (Get the value at a pointer): `*int_pointer;`
---

## Demo
	Goals:
	* [ ] Create a variable
	* [ ] Get the address of that variable
	* [ ] Create a pointer variable
		* [ ] Use it!
---
## But JAKE, why are they *USEFUL*
	* Let's look at an example with pointers and parameters
---
# How can we edit a variable within a function?
---
## Pass by reference*
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void change_value(int *x) { 
		*x = *x * 2;
	}

int main(void) {
  int x = 5;
  change_value(&x);
  printf("%d\n", x);

  return 0;
}
```
	* Technically pass-reference-by-value but it's fine!
---
	In the previous example, by passing the memory address, we can change the value *in place* and main will point to the updated value!
---
## pointers and arrays ðŸ¤¯
```c
void double_array_of_ints(int data[], int size) {
	for (int I = 0; I < size; I++) {
		data[i] = data[i] * 2;
}

int main(void) {
	int data[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
	double_array_of_ints(data, 5);
	//is data doubled?
}
```
	^ does data in main contain the doubled values?
	
---
## How?
---
## Arrays decay to pointers
	* Arrays point to the memory location which contains the first element
	* As arrays are contiguous, we can then move through the memory sequentially to find the next values
	* Very cool!
