## if statements recap
---
	```c
	if(<condition>) {
		do_if_true();
	} else if(<second_condition>) {
		do_if_second_true();
	} else {
		do_if_both_false();
	}	
	```
---
	* A condition is a true/false value (1/0)
	* We can execute an expression to calculate the condition
		* `my_age > drinking_age` -> will evaluate to true/1 if age is greater than `drinking_age`
	* Conditions are useful in many places, if statements, while loops, etc.
---
	#### While loops
	```C
	while(<condition>) {
		do_something_over_and_over();
	}
	```
	* if true, run the body
	* at end of body, check condition again
	* if true, run the body...
---
## Nested loops
---
	* Simply having a `while` loop within a `while` loop
	* Each time the outer loop runs, the inner loop runs an entire set (the inner loop runs *a lot*)
---
### Why are nested loops useful?
---
# Why are nested loops useful?
	How can we print something like this?
```bash
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```
---

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#define ROWS 5
#define COLUMNS 5

int main() {
    int i = 0;

    while (i < ROWS) {
        int j = 1;
        while (j <= COLUMNS) {
            printf("%d ", j);
            j++;
        }
        printf("\n");
        i++;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## What about a half-pyramid?
```bash
1
12
123
1234
12345
```

	## Custom Data Types
---
## Custom data types
	* So far, we have used built-in C data types (int, char, double)
	* These store a single item of that type
	* What if we want to store a group of related data?
---
```c
int main(void) {
	int my_age = 20;
	char initial = 'J';
	int UNSW_year = 2;
	
	return 0;
}
```
	^ These three things are related...
---
	## We can define our own data types (structures) to store a collection of types
---
## Enter the `struct`
---
### UNSW_student struct
```c
struct UNSW_student {
	int age;
	int year_number;
	double WAM;
}
```
	To use, we simply say:
	`struct UNSW_student Jake;`
---
### `struct` (structures)
	* Are variables made up of other variable(s)
	* They have a single identifier
	* Can still access the sub-variables
---
## Defining a struct
```c
struct <struct_name> {
	data_type identifier;
	data_type identifier;
}
```
### Example
```c
struct UNSW_student {
	int age;
	int year_number;
	double WAM;
}
```
---
## Defining a struct
```c
struct <struct_name> {
	data_type identifier;
	data_type identifier;
}
```
### Example
```c
struct UNSW_student {
	int age;
	int year_number;
	double WAM;
}
```
	^ Notice, no values... we are only defining.
---
## Full program example
```c
#include <stdio.h>

struct UNSW_student {
	int age;
	int year_number;
	double WAM;
}

int main(void) {
	struct UNSW_student Jake;

	return 0;
}
```
---
## But how do I access the actual data...
---
## the `.` operator
```c
struct coordinate {
	int x;
	int y;
}
```
```c
struct coordinate loc;

loc.x
loc.y
```
---
## DEMO
---
# Another custom data type
## The `enum`
---
## Imagine I wanted to store days of the week
---
```c
1. int day_of_week = 1;
2. char day_of_week = 'm';

3. #define MONDAY 1
4. #define TUESDAY 2
```
---
## The problem
	* Have to remember that 1 is Monday
	* Could accidentally set 8 to `day_of_week`
---
## Enums (the solution)
	* Store a range or set of possible values
	* Assigns a more meaningful name to state
---
## Syntax
```c
enum enum_name { state_1, state_2, state_3... };
```
## Example
```c
enum weekdays { Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun };
```
---
## Using enums
```c
#include <stdio.h>

enum weekdays { Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun };

int main(void) {
	enum weekdays day;
	day = Sat; // <-- this is why enums are useful
	
	return 0;
}
```
---
## Under the hood
```c
#include <stdio.h>

enum weekdays { Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun }

int main(void) {
	enum weekdays day;
	day = Sat;
	printf("The actual value in day is: %d\n, day);
	
	return 0;
}
```
---
## Advantages over other approaches
	* We provide limitations on the possible values (has to be defined in the enum)
	* We give a nice label to values (Sat)
		* We don't have to remember that 1 is Monday *(or was it 0? ü§î)*
	* Could use `#define` but these can clutter our code if we have many
---
## `struct` ü§ù `enum`
```c
enum student_status { Enrolled, Withdrawn, Leave }

struct student {
	enum student_status status;
	int age;
}
```
