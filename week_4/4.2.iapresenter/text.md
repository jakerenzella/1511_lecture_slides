## Strings recap
	* An array of chars
	* We have a single identifier for the string
	* Anything we can do with arrays, applies
---
## `char[]`

size: contain
	Notice the `\0` at the end! This means that C will know when it reaches the end of the array
	Note the # of elements, and don't forget the `\0`
---
### String literals
#### `"Jake!"`
	* uses double quotes `"` to wrap the string literal
	* single quote for characters!
	* Used to assign strings to `char[]` easily:
	`char name[] = "Jake Renzella";`
// ---
### Useful string functions
	* `fgets()` -> reads a string
	* `fputs()` -> prints a string
	* `strlen()` -> gives us the length of the string (excluding the `\0`).
	* `strcpy()` -> copy the contents of one string to another
	* `strcat()` -> join one string to the end of another (concatenate)
	* `strcmp()` -> compare two strings
	* `strchr()` -> find the first occurrence of a character
	note: some of these may require `#include <string.h>`
---
### Reassigning a string
```c
int main(void) {
	char name[MAX_LEN] = "Jake";
	strcpy(name, "Mr Otterington");
} 
```
	^ Remember we can't reassign like:
	 `name = "Mr Otterington";`

# Arrays of Structs
## Concept Introduction

---
## Structs
	* Structs allow us to store groupings of data
	* We define structs above main and specify each field's type
	* We use the `.` operator to access the field once we initialise a struct!
---
## Arrays
	* We can create arrays to store multiples of data
	* They are homogenous, so can only store the same type

---
	We can have arrays of type (char, int, struct, enum)

## Array of arrays
### 2D arrays
	`<type> <identifier>[<rows>][<cols>];`

```c
int my_grid[5][5];
my_grid[2][3];
