# Arrays of Structs
## Concept Introduction

---
## Structs
	* Structs allow us to store groupings of data
	* We define structs above main and specify each field's type
	* We use the `.` operator to access the field once we initialise a struct!
---
## Arrays
	* We can create arrays to store multiples of data
	* They are homogenous, so can only store the same type

---
## Structs ü§ù Arrays?
