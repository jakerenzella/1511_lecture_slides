## Notes
	* Note, that any autotests or submissions will not be stored on student history and any code written in the exam environment will not be accessible to you once you log out of the exam environment.

---
	* To receive marks, you do not necessarily need to complete all questions - simply make a valid submission (even if it doesn't pass the autotests), or, if completing the exam outside the exam environment, autotest your programs. This will be sufficient for full marks in the week 10 lab. Please do either of these before Week 11 Wednesday to receive full marks for lab 10.
